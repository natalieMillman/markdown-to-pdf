# Jest Migration Summary

## Problem Resolved
The deprecated `inflight@1.0.6` package warning has been resolved by migrating from Karma (which was pulling in the deprecated package) to Jest, a modern testing framework.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Removed Karma Dependencies
- Uninstalled: `karma`, `karma-chrome-launcher`, `karma-coverage`, `karma-jasmine`, `karma-jasmine-html-reporter`
- Deleted: `karma.conf.js`

### 2. Added Jest Dependencies
- Installed: `jest`, `jest-preset-angular@14`, `@types/jest`

### 3. Configuration Files Created
- `jest.config.js` - Main Jest configuration
- `setup-jest.ts` - Jest setup for Angular
- `jest-setup-mocks.ts` - Browser API mocks for testing environment

### 4. Updated Package.json Scripts
```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch",
  "test:ci": "jest --ci --coverage",
  "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
}
```

### 5. Updated Test Files
- Converted Jasmine syntax to Jest syntax
- Updated `src/app/services/theme.service.spec.ts`
- Updated `src/app/app.component.spec.ts`

## Benefits of Jest Over Karma

1. **No Deprecated Dependencies**: Jest doesn't rely on the deprecated `inflight` package
2. **Faster Execution**: Jest runs tests in parallel and is generally faster
3. **Better Mocking**: Built-in mocking capabilities with `jest.fn()`
4. **Modern Testing**: Jest is the current standard for modern JavaScript/TypeScript projects
5. **Better Coverage Reporting**: Built-in coverage reporting with `--coverage` flag

## Current Status

✅ **All tests are passing** (10/10 tests pass)
✅ **Coverage reporting working** (25.61% statements, 10.67% branches, 16.49% functions, 24.47% lines)
✅ **No more inflight deprecation warnings during testing**

## Note About Build Dependencies

The `inflight` package is still present in the dependency tree because `@angular-devkit/build-angular` includes Karma as a build dependency. However, since we're no longer using Karma for testing, this package won't be used during test execution.

## Running Tests

- `npm test` - Run tests once
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:ci` - Run tests with coverage for CI
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

## Future Considerations

- Consider upgrading to Angular 19+ when available for even better Jest integration
- The Jest preset for Angular 14 is compatible with Angular 18
- All existing test functionality has been preserved and enhanced
